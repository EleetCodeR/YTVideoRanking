# A novel approach towards video-ranking using intent and relevance feedback

## Abstract

The “Internet” today has rapidly morphed into a
large platform for learning purposes. As a result, large amounts
of instructional videos are being produced every day and are
uploaded to video repository platforms like “YouTube”. The
video-ranking methodology employed by such platforms largely
focuses on video-description and user-ratings as a direct criterion.
This often leads to less relevant videos being ranked higher
than others and creates a “search-intention and relevance gap”
between users’ search query and video results that are shown. As
these platforms also allow users to express their opinion about
videos, in this paper, we propose a video re-ranking methodology
IRF (Intent and Relevance Feedback) to improve the rank of
the relevant videos, where we emphasize determining the impact
of using unexplored video aspects, like “user comments” and
“video’s content” in the video ranking and index calculation
