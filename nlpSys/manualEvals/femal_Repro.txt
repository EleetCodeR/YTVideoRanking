I don't believe she said the egg is a somatic cell rather it has half the chromosomes of a somatic cell, it's a little mumbled.


There are a few more in there too such as the EGG being called a somatic cell it is a meiotic one. I really hope that she can go back and fix this it wasn't too bad very short.


I have some more inaccuracies to report to go along with DonUC, The egg is not a somatic cell its a meiotic cell, Somatic cells are those like bones heart muscle. the egg is part of reproduction and because it has undergone a decrease of chromosomes it is a meiotic cell. Don't believe everything you hear on the internet.

Nice Voice

Interesting, Were talking about this in class and the professor and the book said that "a decrease in Estrogen+ progesterone lead to 2 things. First, endometrium degenerates --> end of cycle. or Second: remove neg. Feedback on Hypothamlus --> increase in GnRH --> start new cycle" so i would assume it has to do with estrogen also....

Maraming Salamat po!!


this video is precise and clear!

I learned more from this video... In science were learning about this stuff 
male and female so people might think its gross topic to talk about but others learn about it and its life.

lmao

thank you very much for you help , really appreciate it x  

THIS BITCH IS SOO ANNOYING WITH HER HUFFING PUFFING AND SMACKING SWALLOWING.I AM SOOO ANNOYED, SHE GAVE ME ANXIETY.

why did i even click on this? 

@ DonUC:  Good for you.  Now please consolidate this into a one-sentence byte that won't confuse the students and works with the flow of the instruction, since this is a high-level overview.

what an annoying voice.. fucken hell

that


thanks a lot

u voice annoying

Gosh, the reproductive system for females just look plain weird.

@weysst because it does...if u find this interesting then go ahead!! m not stopping u

OMG!!! i have a test tomorrow on this and when i watch these ...i feel like 
to VOMIT!!

Hi

Menstruation is not induced by estrogen but by a sudden fall in progesteron 
secretion, meaning stratum functionale in the endometrium will collapse and 
the bleeding begin. If pregnancy occours corpus luteum will persist and thereby progesteron secretion will not decrease.

Kind regards

this speaker sucks..informative though.

I enjoyed the overview as it helped trigger some of the more detailed information I am currently studying. Will definitely check out your other vids. :)

download realplayer

yes, this is called an ectopic pregnancy. it can attach in the tube as well, this is not uncommon and should be treated immediately since it can lead to rupture upon development of the fetus

your vid is good, but i hate the way you talk... like ur talking it in a boring way... or i think ur bored when ur discussing dis... but good video anyway..it really helped me...

Thanks Again belive or not you hepled me! lol

Excellent!

This is amazing

.chk my channel for handwriting‚úç

Please make some more videos!! Do muscles and bones! Do the biology part of 
anatomy like diffusion, concentration gradient, etc! Your videos are so helpful and I have until September 23rd to take my hesi!

There are several factors in learning human anatomy. One plan I found which 
succeeds in merging these is the Sebs Study Crammer  (check it out on google) without a doubt the most helpful course that I have ever seen. look at this  awesome website.

Eschool be wild these days

y the fuk is there a man doing this shit

Thanks that tutorial was the best helped me a lot

Thanks Handwritten tutorials for making it so simple ‚ò∫‚ò∫

There are several components to studying anatomy. One place I discovered which succeeds in merging these is the Anatomy Blueprint Pro (google it if you're interested) without a doubt the most incredible info i've heard of. Check out this  awesome resource.

come back bro

it is nothing

Not uploading anymore?

Please make more videos !!!

Some idiots think females have sperm ;-;
Sent them this video

I'd be even better if you didn't take annoying pauses

Can you draw us how babies are made?

https://youtu.be/xcP4RUztOPA....Kindly watch this link...RAHMAN BIOLOGY CLASSES(RBC) has started its online tutorials....Do give ur suggestions....     

I love it

Guys please. Instead of posting another comment requesting the guy to come back, why don't just make a small donation? I know how you feel, but if you want to support the channel, it's the donation that makes a difference. Pretty sure making a request alone will not do anything.

I used to think saying biology pictures are cute would be an oxymoron :), but these biology drawings are actually so cute.

Who‚Äôs here for an exam 

üëé
