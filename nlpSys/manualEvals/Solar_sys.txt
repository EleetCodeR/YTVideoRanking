Nice I, like this

Hey Sir

Sir Can u make a new topic about the density and how will measuring all planets and its structure 🤔

Thanks a sir a lot you help me lot plz sub my channel name conqueror gaming 

its wrong there was not any star near sun , planets formed due to gravity planets are formed around a new star by condensing in a disc of molecular gas 
and dust, embedded within a larger molecular cloud. Condensation increases until they become giant planets, which are heated, then cleanse their orbits 
in the disc and possibly bend it. please dont spread wrong information.     

Sir..sun is god

@prashantdhawan sir op 🔥

Not giving exact information

U r useless

:D
Plz like

Imagine we discover a new planet and we send a machine there to hear what it sounds like and all we hear is
 *lamp oil rope bombs-*

It's either there are other planet in another galaxy which holds life or we're the only living humans in the universe.
Both are terrifying

Have u ever think the possibility that earth isn't the only planet that has 
a life, living organisms or perhaps, human?

Created by the Almighty Allah. Soon it shall all be revealed to all of us.  

Earth is unique among the rest of planets inside our solar system.... those 
first word country is the toxic that's why we continue to develop yet distroyed our own planet..

My teacher brought me here

hello My name is Indriyani, I studied at SMK BAKTI NUSA Bogor Indonesia and 
I am in 11th grade, after I saw the video above, I was able to learn about the solar system which is not a little learned at school. Besides the discussion that can be understood and the explanation process is very interesting , after I saw the video, it turns out that the galaxy is very beautiful, the 
video is very insightful, hopefully many students can watch this video and make it a learning medium, thank you

when i was a kid, I thought that all planets are filled with life, that was 
awesome week

now that's very interesting to see and learn i like it!

Yo Guys it's me yo boi earth

These are true facts 

The Only Planets That Has Air For Flying Ballons Are: Saturn And Jupiter    

Terrestrial:
Mercury❤️, Venus❤️, Earth❤️, Mars❤️
Jovian:
Jupiter❤️, Saturn❤️, Uranus❤️, Neptune❤️

Sun With 8 Planets

i believe in other solar solar systems, there will be countless life and also travel to different planets as a norm as we would a holiday, awwww what we will never know it just sore!

Hi, I´m Sarah. I´m fron United States. and this video is so good. I think I 
learn something about this.
People on Earth. I want to go to mars, but I´m scared of aliens. hahahahaha.
aliens on mars:   I want to go to the Earth, but there the humans can kill us 0_0 give a like for the video. I give it a like because It is very well done and very well edited. 

The video incorrectly implies the Sun's gravitational influence ends at a specific radius.

The genders for the solar system are mercury is a boy Venus is a girl earth 
is a girl Mars is a boy Jupiter is a boy Saturn is a girl Uranus is a girl and Neptune is a boy

how about moon??

dislikes are from people who watched this in school

we are wonder and small creature. but we have ability to ruin  or animated our earth..

This is breathtakingly amazing!

If you are going to do an educational video you might want to pronounce Uranus right. Smh

Antei l love to be an astronomical pleas pray for me

where is my homie pluto

Everyone has a dream of getting lost in space by purpose.
But when NASA sends you an email to register for ''lost in the space program'', the real fear comes when you type your name in the name column....      

Who else got anxiety watching this

Mmmmmmmmm Makavitage and the other side

You  Pagle

Oooohhhhhh 💯💯

UrAnus
Hahaha get it?
;-;

Earth It is so beautiful place

Very nice explanation. Did you know that our Solar System was formed after an ancient star that exploded? It is believed that our Sun is a third-generation star since the Big Bang

Very good

Very good

Hi

Hi

Pluto is missing is he on vacation?

Other Planets: Rotate




Uranus: *Let me show you some real joyland!*

informative videos ,Thanks for sharing... 

Mercury : pluto orbit c'mon. I know you know.
Pluto : dad sun will you please tell them orbiting is dangerous like the way theia hit earth.
Sun : maybe theia must have not known what she was doing.
Pluto:  ugh dad c'mon you've had four daughters one is gone and now you have three.
Scientists : Pluto your a dwarf.
Pluto: oops. I need to orbit.
Scientists: too late.
Mercury:I told you.
Pluto:Why. 

Where's Pluto?

Where am I? This stuff is so dope.  Now I'm consciously aware we are parasites living in this planet,  at the same time humans are so intelligent. This 
realization makes me try harder in everything everyday.

At first, all of the planets are the same size, then later on in the video, 
they are different sizes... This might confuse some people.

✌️✌️

Pluto is a planet ;-;

on all the planets of the solar system do you know how many of them were discovered by the Americans? ..... the answer is .... 0 !....... :)

But Jupiter has no rings 

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍The first 28th and the other night we

Did she speak English the whole time? 😂

Saturn have 82 moons

Our solar system is one of over 500 known solar systems in the milky way galaxy the solar system came into being about 4.5 billion years ago  when a cloud of interstellar gas and dust and forming a solar nebula the turned into the solar system Mercury
The planet mercury also the smallest planet and the second hottest mercury is so small and the core of it is cooling so it makes it shrink Venus the hottest planet and it's clouds preventing heat from getting out which makes it 
the hottest planet in the solar system next of this world of fire is a world of water Earth a planet that only consist of water humans trees etc making 
it the only planet with life Mars Mars's red hue is also known from blood and war only 3.7 billion years ago it had water Jupiter jupiter is the largest planet of our solar system the most fascinating thing about jupiter is a crimson brown storm which is been raging for hundreds of years the great red spot it is commonly the size of 2-3 earths but it is shrinking it has belts of yellows whites browns reds The Galilean Satellites (TGS) are the four biggest moons of Jupiter Ganymede Callisto Io Europa under the surface of Europa it has a vast ocean Saturn Saturn is the only planet with rings that are big Titan Saturn's biggest moon quite smaller than Ganymede Jupiter's  biggest moon Titan and Ganymede are bigger than Mercury Uranus most of its funny name uranus seem to have a weird angle it is 98° and it looks like it's tilted this may be caused of Uranus's collision with other objects it affected its rings and moons it's moons orbit Uranus like a ferris wheel Neptune like Jupiter it has a spot the great dark spot it was the size of the entire Earth 
Neptune's rings are very young much younger of the rings of Uranus the largest moon of Neptune is Triton it may have a subsurface ocean
