# Animal kingdom vertebrates and invertebrates

 ========================== VID - L6anmd7DnYw ========================== 

We want all 10 phylum of non-chordates

Phyla =/= 'Filla' #porifera

finally, an youtube video that say ther are 5 kingdoms, this is how we (in europe) learned at the school, it's very annoying that other country from different continents have another sistem, everytime when i search information about a plant or an animal i get very confuse

🇧🇩

Some spelling is wrong

I thought you sound like my teacher ngl
When he show the class this video at zoommeeting
His voice sound similar to the video voice

Because you said "Oder"

Are you Germany

Sir this video was nice. But I'm not into this cause it was too fast        

Sir, thaks for this video

is there a way to remove the background music.. its disturbing

Good morning Children
l'am your new Sir

There are several mistakes in this video.

On the tree shown at 1.30, Echinodermata is spelled incorrectly, it should say "echinodermata" not "echinodertmata"

Again on the tree the arrow from Cnidaria to Oysters and clams should also come from Mollusc, NOT cnidaria.

As a Science Teacher I am very disappointed as I usually recommend Fuse School to my students but I don't think I will in future as this is not the first time I have found errors in the videos. 

science must keep in mind that the classification is only our organizational system imposed upon nature.
We all are deeply aware that if something is repeated long enough, in the human psyche it becomes like cement.
This is a barrier to change. If science determines something as true, but it goes against this classification system, changing that system is difficult, but not impossible.
Remember Pluto. 

he is here  fro quaratie t o ;llllllll;

How to remember Hierarchy of Classification of Groups:
Kingdom phylum class order family genus species
KING PHILIP CAN ONLY FIND GREEN SLIPPERS.

My middle school grade 3 teacher told me this. Hope this will help you :)   

Nice video.thank you so much 

Oysters and clams are mollusks, not cnidaria

But I don't understand the part 2:50
.Can you please tell

Nice video

Must I go on? 

In science, History has observed and remembered that religion has frowned upon questioning long held beliefs. Like the sun orbiting around the earth.   
Is science now doing the same thing that religion did centuries earlier?    
If a professor in science questions evolution and brings up points of logical dispute, What happens to that professor?
We all should think long and hard on this point. It is possible that science has been going down a pathway called evolution, that is incorrect.
We all know that adaptive change happens. This is observable. However adaptive change does not account for the complexity of the cell.
It is possible that scientific ideas become so vast in scope that one mind can not concieve of all the knowledge contained within.
We have scientists that are experts in many different fields of study, with 
the over arching principal of evolution as a guide post. But no one is an expert in all the fields.

There is bias in everyday life that science does not account for. We see what we expect to see. Where as true science will take you, the observer, to the truth.
This is something scientists claim religious people are guilty of. Ignoring 
the evidence and only observing proof of intelligent design.
However the scientists who point this potent fact out, must also be accutely aware that they are guilty of the same exact thing... aren't they?
A religious person has humility to admit this. But a professor might be puffed up with pride and can not ever admit to such a scientific sin?
Am I completely incorrect?

I am not saying one side is correct or incorrect, but it would be wise for both sides, and even people who are not directly involved in the debate, to take a step back and try to observe the larger picture.
Why are scientists who question evolution met with extreme vitriol and hate?

The evidence is still of a greater wisdom, understanding and power than     
anything we know of. Seventeen (17) of the most common elements (atoms)     
in the universe are absolutely essential working parts inside of us. (No    
 essential working part ever made itself, in real life.) An additional      
equal amount of the common elements are beneficial to life (not
harmful). The essential molecules for life break down at a much faster      
rate than they supposedly put themselves into directed working order, by    
 mistake. Keep looking for magic. You will never find it. 

Evolution is an illegitimate faith. 

Weird

I wish their was a non evolution version

What about domains? System with 3 domains (bacteria, archea and eukaryota) is more accurate

Nice content. I'm shooting this kind of videos if you want to subscribe     

Too fast

1:13 THANK YOU

Thanks so much ❤️

Wait
Spider is not in arthropods there are in arachnids

Wait

not understanding what u speak. going too fast

Nice

amazing video. Thanku sir for helping us with such informative videos 🙏    

🇮🇳🇮🇳👌🙏

um... is this in English? I mean it probably is i just wanted to make sure. 

The Lord was created from the light of Muhammad and Muhammad the whole universe

Wow

I was the first to watch

It is wrong naming 

thanku

Very educative, nice job

Nice

Importance for us.

Thanks to Anne and Bob I passed Biology

I already know this fck!

there are 6 kingdoms. 

NICE VIDEO

What a wonderful video is this my child likes this video

Just a little quick review

add a public comment....

Very fast to watch😊😊😊😊

Dude fuck learning all these orders!!’n

Good video

Very nice

Boringggggggggg

The 5 kingdom system is VERY old and obsolete at this point.  The hypothesis/theory for the 3 domain system has much more support for it.  This is especially important if any of your students/viewers plan to take a university level biology course.

So boring 😌😌

My child learnt a lot of information about animal kingdom 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼.     

Very nice explanations

Thanks Very good Explanation and nice video.

If anyone want to know about Basic Earth worm structure in detail and its MORPHOLOGY, LOCOMOTION ETC. Please watch following video

It is nice and useful  too

Talking too fast and boring

mostly diffdes in to vetabred un vetabred

Why such dramatic song in the background

nice i love it

Hi.  I'm looking for your other video Classifying organisma.  Could you share the link please.

ITS JAHMES

First to watch!
